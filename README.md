# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course
Anteckningar

## Summary

An AI-powered assistant that monitors plants’ health, predicts watering needs, and suggests optimal care using sensor and weather data. Att bygga AI-kursprojekt.


## Background

The project aims to solve common problems in plant care:

Overwatering or underwatering plants.

Difficulty in identifying plant diseases early.

Lack of personalized care advice for different plant types.

Many plant owners struggle to keep their plants healthy, and this can lead to frustration or wasted resources. I am personally motivated by my love for indoor gardening and the challenge of using AI to solve practical everyday problems.


## How is it used?

The system collects real-time data from sensors (moisture, light, temperature) and online weather forecasts. Users can access insights through a mobile or web app:

Alerts when plants need watering.

Notifications about unusual conditions (e.g., risk of disease).

Personalized suggestions for fertilizer or repositioning.

Users are plant owners who want to improve plant health and reduce maintenance effort.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources:

IoT sensors for soil moisture, sunlight, temperature.

Weather API for forecasts.

Plant database for species-specific care guidelines.

AI techniques:

Supervised learning models for predicting watering needs.

Anomaly detection for early disease detection.

Reinforcement learning could optimize care strategies over time.

## Challenges

The model may not generalize to rare plant species.

Sensor errors or missing data could affect predictions.

Ethical concerns: users might rely solely on AI and ignore common-sense plant care.

## What next?
Integrate more sensor types (humidity, nutrient sensors).

Expand plant species database.

Develop a community feature where users can share tips and insights.

Explore computer vision for automatic disease detection from leaf images.
